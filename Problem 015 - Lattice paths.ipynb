    "The trick to this question is realizing that there is a symmetry along every grid's diaginal axis. Only the routes to the vertices along the diagonal of the square (from the top right to the bottom left) need to be calculated. As there must be an equal number of routes into each vertex as out, squaring the routes into any vertex will yield all the possible routes from the starting corner to the ending corner that pass through said vertex. Adding all these squares together will result in the total number of routes from start to finish.\n",

    "$1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 6$ so there are 6 routes in a 2x2 grid.\n",

    "In a 3x3 grid, there are 4 vertices along the diagonal. There is 1 way to get to the top right corner, 1 way to get to the bottom left corner, and 3 ways to get each of the two vertices in the middle.  \n",
