Project Euler Problems

Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.

Link to the site: https://projecteuler.net/ 

The files in this repo are my solutions to the first 16 problems.  

The biggest insight I have as a result of working through these problems is that math algorithms consistently rely on the implementation and focus around prime numbers.

As of 1/1/2023, there are a total of 814 problems on record.
